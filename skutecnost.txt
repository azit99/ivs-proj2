- Some deadlines weren't met on time mainly because of other school projects.
- The team work wasn't as easy as we expected. Sometimes there were some minor comunication problems which caused
  the workflow to slow down a bit.
- Also there were some bug fixes committed after the deadline
- We had problems with installer creation and because of that, the installer was finally done right before
  the official deadline of the project.
